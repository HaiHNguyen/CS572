Dear Professor,
I use IntelliJ to do exercise so I use superagent (https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent)
instead of HTTPClient to write client code for exercise 6.

Please advise if it is ok. If not, I will re-write my exercise using VS and HTTPClient.

Client code is under  client folder:
- GetGrade.js: Get a grade record.
- GetGrades.js: Get all grade records.
- CreateGrade.js: Create a grade record.
- UpdateGrade.js: Update an existing grade record.
- DeleteGrade.js: Delete a grade record.


Thanks and best regards,
Hai Hong, Nguyen.
