1. Explain why do we sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
Answer:It is faster because it does not use queue of function. It checks queue of I/O eventhandlers.
If all I/O events in the current snapshot are processed, it executes the callback


2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
Answer:
- Process.nextTick is not part of event loop. It adds the callback into nextTick queue
- Node processes all callbacks in the nextTick queue after current operations completes and before
the event loop continues.
